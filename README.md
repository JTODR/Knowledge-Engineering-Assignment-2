# Queries
* All queries are detailed in their relevant query files included expected parameter order and expected return values.
* Each query requires parameters, as a result, I am using a string of the form "%PARAM_N%" in order to inject the parameters into each query via simple string replacement. This should be sufficient for our purposes.
